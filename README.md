# Covid-data-exploration
Real covid-19 data data exploration with SQL.
Then we walk through how to break apart the data to find insights. This project goes to intermediate level concepts so some knowledge of SQL is recommended.
Either you can use the uploaded data set or can download the data from the url https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .
